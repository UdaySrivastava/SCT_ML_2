## Problem Statement : Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
This project implements a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Customer segmentation is a crucial task in retail analytics, helping businesses understand customer behavior, personalize marketing strategies, and improve customer engagement.

Objective : The goal of this project is to categorize customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing patterns. By analyzing transaction data, the algorithm identifies groups of customers with similar shopping behaviors, allowing businesses to tailor promotions, recommend products, and optimize inventory management.
